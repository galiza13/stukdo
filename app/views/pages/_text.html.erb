<p> require('bootstrap') will load all of Bootstrap's jQuery plugins onto the jQuery object. The bootstrap module itself does not export anything. You can manually load Bootstrap's jQuery plugins individually by loading the /js/*.js files under the package's top-level directory.

Bootstrap's package.json contains some additional metadata under the following keys:

less - path to Bootstrap's main Less source file
style - path to Bootstrap's non-minified CSS that's been precompiled using the default settings (no customization)
Autoprefixer required for Less/Sass
Bootstrap uses Autoprefixer to deal with CSS vendor prefixes. If you're compiling Bootstrap from its Less/Sass source and not using our Gruntfile, you'll need to integrate Autoprefixer into your build process yourself. If you're using precompiled Bootstrap or using our Gruntfile, you don't need to worry about this because Autoprefixer is already integrated into our Gruntfile.</p>
